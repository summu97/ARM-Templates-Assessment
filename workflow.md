### Step 04: Create and Run Pipeline

1. **Create a Pipeline**:
   - Navigate to the **Pipelines** section of your Azure DevOps project.
   - Click on **Create Pipeline** to start a new pipeline setup.

2. **Select Repository**:
   - Choose **Azure Repos Git** as your source.
   - Select the project and repository you imported earlier.

3. **Select Existing YAML File**:
   - Choose **Existing Azure Pipelines YAML file** to link the pipeline to an existing YAML configuration.

## Important Notes

- **Update Configuration File**:
   Before running the pipeline, make sure to modify the following parameters in the `azure-pipeline.json` configuration file:
